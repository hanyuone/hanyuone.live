# Hello, World!

Hi! My name is Hanyuan, and I made this website mainly as a vehicle for me
to write blogs - things I want to share with the world. This could include
creative endeavours (mostly in terms of writing), self-promotions, or things
I have general thoughts/opinions on. Some general things you can expect here are:

- **Programming**. This is what I study at university, what I will most likely be
doing as a job in the future, and something I do as a hobby.
- **Translations**. This is probably my main creative medium, and a nice way to
improve both my Chinese and English creative writing skills.
- **Writing**. I want to try writing more in general. One big project that I've got
in store to publish is a full Magic: the Gathering guide.

Hope you enjoy your time here!
