What a strange material... it looks similar to gold but not quite, almost as if it's "stuck" in an ever-changing state. It can turn almost liquid like mercury, or be as hard as diamonds, or have brown patterns, or glowing cracks - deep and shallow grooves sometimes appear as well, with its patterns seeming like anything from ancient cave paintings to clay-stained fingerprints. This all depends on the semantic stream you put it in contact with. Put the metal in the hands of a thousand different people and you'll see a thousand different changes.

However, no matter how many times you put this metal in contact with, say, a piece of rock, it doesn't change at all. But humans are different - and the metal reflects that, being ever-changing yet constant. Placed in a person's hands, the overall characteristics of the metal won't change, but its details seem to respond to that person's every action... why is that?

What a strange metal - since it's similar to gold, what say we name it "aurite"?

This metal has revealed the nature of semantic streams that we've never discovered before, regarding its dampening when in contact with immatter. Some streams are more resistant, and thus become less dampened when they travel through immatter. Aurite is revealing this to us!

We could potentially use aurite to find out which semantic streams are more suitable to be transmitted between bubbles, find out the characteristics of those streams, which we can use to our advantage. Only civilisations which have traversed through immatter are capable of carrying out this research.

We need to broadcast this finding as much as possible, and get more bubbles involved in researching this anomalous metal. Investigating the unknown, this is what the Foundation was made for.

We can quantify the reaction of aurite on semantic streams. Aurite can be in myriad different forms, but just like Fourier transforms converting complex signals into distinct frequencies, we can find stable characteristics from the different forms that aurite can take. The calculations are immensely difficult, and it's hard to imagine how to even get our research results through the 95% dampening rate... but I believe that every Foundation researcher in every bubble will eventually discover this methodology.

This is not just quantitative research into the forms that aurite can take. What aurite actually does is it shows the characteristics of semantic streams as they travel through immatter, so what we're really quantitatively researching is semantic stream characteristics. As research continues, we can extract a series of figures from these semantic streams, from which we can analyse the reaction that immatter has on the streams themselves.

Maybe we could combine these figures together and call it a "characteristic vector".

I am but a humble smith, I haven't been involved with the Foundation's research into the anomalous, but I know that this metal is extraordinary - to me it's the perfect metal, the perfect material. I've never seen a piece of metal that's so malleable when I put it in my hand - almost like wet clay... no, that's not quite it, it's also able to hold its shape after sculpting and hammering. I feel like it's sentient, it's got a soul - it becomes hard or soft almost in response to me wishing it to be so.

It's alive. To me, it's a living thing.

How is this possible? All of my first instincts work on the metal, if I add some carbon it becomes hard, add some copper and it becomes lustrous, some aluminium, chromium...  I'm still trying new mixes and proportions, and the process is... unexpectedly smooth-sailing. How is everything going so successfully, how is there a metal that listens to my every need? It's almost as if this metal belongs to only me, since it doesn't behave like this in the hands of other researchers. Is this a sign from above?

The only problem is there's little... far too little... of this metal, and I ran out before I was done experimenting. I have no intention of squabbling with the Foundation, their research is important as well, but I want more of this perfect metal. One kilogram? Two? One hundred? I don't know at this point, I fear I may never be satisfied.

> The Rustsmith Trade Alliance has established itself for a good while now, but truthfully speaking, while there do exist smiths who can rival or surpass our founder Master Chengqi Kong's skills, few if any share the same fiery passion he has. Every time Master Kong talks about aurite, you can see the spark in his eyes. The only example that approaches how he feels about aurite is perhaps Pygmalion in Ancient Greece, laying eyes on his ivory sculpture. To Master Kong, aurite is his Galatea.

I successfully reached bubble CR-KV. The researchers at CR-KH were very professional, they controlled the timing on the transmission window well, I was able to travel through immatter without any injuries. I am grateful to them, they spent so much time and energy on sending someone as sickly as me to where I want to go. I do not think I need to trouble them any more in the foreseeable future. I wish them all the best.

The research group at CR-KV has been very passionate, just from their first impressions I knew I came to the right place. The antimatter waves here are more active than in other bubbles, and it is also easier to observe microscopic particles here - these will be of great benefit to restarting my research on system symmetries. Should nothing else change, I believe this will be my new place of residence.

I had a tour of their hadron collider today - it is large, massive. The environment in this bubble is pristine, and they have utilised it well - you can almost say this is the ideal place for any anomalous physics researcher. There are two clear problems, however - the first happened when they were performing maintenance checks on the CMS detector. Apparently it was something that only started yesterday, but there was a strange metal that was stuck onto some of the parts. They said it was called "aurite" - I have heard of the name before, but this was the first time I saw it with my own eyes. I can see they are worried, but it is fine as long as we are going according to plan - they should not need to feel guilty if some hiccups happened with my transportation, I feel they are overly stiff with me. In order to adjust to this new environment, I still have a lot of preparation that I can do before beginning the experiments.

Another problem is that, no matter where I go, I feel like someone is always following me, observing my condition. And whenever I have to use sensors with radiation, they become very nervous... all of them are kind people at heart, I know they are looking out for me, but I do not think there is any use in doing so. Cystic fibrosis has not been cured in the last 1,000 years, I doubt there are going to be any leaps in the medical space here.

It's safe to say that our bubble, X0-BA, is the most "brilliant" out there, literally speaking. The elders here always say that on the day immatter arrived, they saw the sun high above shatter into ten orbs, which swirled around with the immatter that blocked out the sky before crashing down into vast forest on the bubble's west.

Logically, the story makes no sense - the sun is extremely far away from immatter, and there is no way for it to separate into ten orbs that just so happened to land in our bubble. But that is the reality we live in now - no matter what time of day, the forest to the west shines in all directions for miles, with ten pillars of dazzling light flitting about inside. Despite this, the orbs don't actually generate that much heat, instead acting like moving searchlights, you can see them from the observatory. We don't really know what they are, perhaps something like the physical manifestation of "brightness". I can't  provide a better conclusion.

Regardless of what they really are, the ten "suns" pose a lot of problems. The western forest is now sealed off, with ample resources that we can't extract. Furthermore, we have reason to believe that the strange, heatless light they emit heavily interferes with semantic stream broadcasts coming from other bubbles. We're already experiencing heavy dampening from all the immatter, having these ten extra suns is just adding insult to injury.

I have just received the broadcast from bubble DV-SA, where three newborn babies passed due to complications with immatter. This is absolutely heart-wrenching news. And just now, right here in this bubble, there are two more babies in intensive care due to immatter interference. Tiny pieces of immatter, lodged in their brains which cannot yet comprehend the beauty of this world, cause them to wail without pause every night. I am no doctor, I'm not capable of making their pain go away, but I sincerely hope that every citizen in our bubble can join me in prayer, to pray that these two newborn souls can overcome this obstacle.

Most importantly, I hope that their parents do not lose hope. Being born with immatter will not harm them for life, these two souls can definitely overcome it, because I'm living proof. Even now, I can feel the small piece of immatter in my brain, like a pebble in a snowglobe, clashing against my every thought and emotion. But I'm alive, because my parents never gave up on me, they allowed me to grow and thrive, and thus that piece of immatter never stopped me from adding new chapters to my life story in this bubble, nor did it stop me from discovering the voice that they would be proud of.

So, those two kids aren't given a death sentence by being born with immatter. They will survive, I have faith in that, and I hope everyone will share in that same faith. Through everyone's belief, we can create a miracle!

> Ms. Shu is correct, the united faith she called upon did create a miracle. We survived and became Sorrowed Songstresses, and under the guidance of Ms. Shu, our voices resounded through the bubble. If every soul taken from the clutches of birth with immatter is a miracle, then Ms. Yongmo Shu, the first Sorrowed Songstress, is a miracle among miracles.

To all the drunkards in 1K-ZZ, this is a special broadcast, as of today I'm stopping all business in the bubble. I've got two reasons - number one, I haven't received any insightful, honest-to-god opinions on my brews, all I hear are noises masquerading themselves as thoughts, bland as a cup of water. Don't blame it on things like immatter, or dampening, we're all in the same bubble, I can hear you loud and clear! If I offer something that I've invested my precious time into to you lot, that'll be satisfied with anything as long as it burns the throat, then sorry, I can't keep this going on much longer!

You people are ungrateful! Ungrateful, you hear me!

Number two, of course, my mother taught me to look inwards more often when running into problems. I'll admit it's a bit toxic, like yeast that's gone bad, but at least it's still yeast, there's a difference between that and dried-out fruit with no more juice left to give. I have to say, I'm not that satisfied with my works, maybe that's why it's not enough to awaken you uninspired lot. I've got to hone my craft even more.

If there's a million-in-one chance, a miracle that there's someone out there hooked on my spirits, you have a discerning eye, you have great taste. But unfortunately I have to ask you to be patient, and to trust in me. I need to seal myself from the outside world and refine my brews. Wait for me, until I craft my own ambrosia - I guarantee you'll be euphoric for a thousand days!

Regarding today's broadcast, our research group feels it necessary to coordinate recently-coined technical terms between bubbles, in order to more accurately exchange information even during periods of high dampening. In order to achieve this goal, the most traditional, "ugly" way ends up being the most effective. We hope that all bubbles that receive this broadcast can follow in our example and try their hardest in broadcasting this unified terminology. Below is the transcript of the official broadcast:

I've been a broadcaster for 3 or 4 years now, but I've never been to the locked room at the very top of the broadcasting tower. Rumors say that when broadcasters from nearby bubbles first assume their roles, a researcher from the SCP Foundation will take them to visit that room, only once. And in that room is a [satellite](https://scp-wiki-cn.wikidot.com/scp-cn-651) from the old times, playing a very old song - "The East is Red".

Personally, I find that hard to believe.

[DAMPENING] the fifty-seventh broadcast from Igor Kaminev. The AIC system on board in the last [DAMPENING] experienced calculation malfunctions, and could not avoid a piece of immatter that was directly in its course. But I'm very fortunate, I didn't experience any dampening, instead [DAMPENING] at a bubble in low Earth orbit. Immatter has cut off all [DAMPENING] I may "die in the darkness" as stated in oath, but as of right now I'm alive, I'm breathing, and I will continue broadcasting [DAMPENING] every instruction by the Foundation Eastern Command.

Currently [DAMPENING] the ship's in good condition. I have already taken inventory of existing supplies, they will last me for another one to two months. The AIC has also scanned the bubble's atmosphere, [DAMPENING] extracting elemental carbon and oxygen to print materials, for this purpose the AIC [DAMPENING] modifying the standard-issue surveying unmanned drone. I'm also carefully observing the bubble's [DAMPENING] If I do find a window, no matter how small, I won't miss [DAMPENING] I will do my all to return to formation.

I know I may [DAMPENING] even after all this effort, no miracle will happen, and I'll meet the end of my life in action. But I have no regrets, I made an oath to the SCP Foundation Eastern Command [DAMPENING] and am immensely honoured to do so. This is Pilot Igor Kaminev signing out to the SCP Foundation Eastern Command. All the best.

[DAMPENING] will send a broadcast again in one hour.

> More precisely, Pilot Igor Kaminev, the supervisor of Node 13, is not in bubble TM-A4. Bubble TM-A4 is located directly below Node 13, and the bubble that Node 13 is in does not have an ID, because it is located outside Earth in low orbit.
> 
> In the year 2995 (old calendar), each command of the SCP Foundation sent exploratory space forces of sizes 10 to 20, in order to explore the movement patterns of the imminently-arriving immatter. The ships that they pilot can withstand long-term missions in space, and in the following five standard years they performed beyond expectations. However, as they were scheduled to return, the airspace above the Eastern Domain experienced unexpected levels of immatter turbulence. Because of this, the at-the-time premature AIC system experienced large amounts of calculation errors when factoring in the complex interactions between immatter and semantic streams. In this emergency situation, the captain Igor Kaminev gave up his chance to escape to a younger pilot, disappearing into the immatter mass in the process. We all thought that, on that day, Igor Kaminev sacrificed himself.
> 
> However, in the twenty or so years when a new "normalcy" was established, there was a period of time where the immatter situation in the area surrounding bubble TM-A4 was rather ideal. In the proceeding broadcast acceptance windows, bubble TM-A4 unexpectedly received messages from outer space, by Igor Kaminev. Even stranger than that is, from the broadcast's signatures, Igor Kaminev is not just alive, but the turbulence only happened the day before.
> 
> With the situation as strange as it is, bubble TM-A4 ultimately decided to continue broadcasting semantic streams into space as a response. We finally received a reply after a seemingly endless period of silence, and only then did we truly understand what happened.
